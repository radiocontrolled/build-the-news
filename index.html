		<p>Please don’t do it, please don’t do it — that’s what I remember saying out loud,” says Officer X, talking about the day he killed a man. “He had fired some shots earlier and now he was behaving erratically, waving his gun around. I said to my partner, ‘Something’s going to go very wrong, very fast,’ and, three or four seconds later, it did. </p>
		<p>“The gunman’s body language changed. It was as if he was building up to something and then he lowered his gun as if to fire. He left me with no option. I thought, ‘Oh God, no — he’s going to shoot…’ and I fired once. He fell out of view, then I heard over the radio that he had been pronounced dead. </p>
		<p>“I feel sorry for his family, but I can’t feel sorry for him. If anything, there’s anger. I am angry that he put me in that position. I have replayed the incident a thousand times in my head, and a thousand times I come to the conclusion that there was nothing else I could do. The inquest jury agreed, but on another day it could have been different and I could be facing charges for manslaughter or murder because of a split-second decision.” </p>
		<p>Officer X, a 44-year-old father of two young children, is one of only a handful of serving cops in the Metropolitan Police who have killed in the line of duty. It is not a badge any of them wears with pride, yet when you ask, they tend to say they would do it again. </p>
		<p>“If you accept the fact that there are bad people out there with guns and you want someone to protect you from them, then you also have to accept that, from time to time, we will be left with no choice but to use our weapons,” says one of Officer X’s colleagues. “We will use them only as a last resort, but we will use them. And that means that sometimes people will die.” </p>
		<p>If you think this last statement sounds defensive, then you would be right. These officers are among 476 gun cops who comprise the Met’s Specialist Firearms Command, also called SC&O19. Recently, Commander Neil Basu of Specialist Crime and Operations (which includes SC&O19) predicted that as many as half of them might put down their weapons if plans went ahead to stop them conferring after shootings. It was a remarkable statement — to suggest that half your department might refuse to do its job — yet it is indicative of the way his officers feel about their role as firearms officers and the public’s perception of them.
		</p>
		<p>Because of a legal challenge and a series of recommendations from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), firearms officers could soon also be quarantined from their colleagues after incidents in which people have been shot. Furthermore, within a year they may be required to wear cameras with their guns. </p>
		<p>“We accept that our job can be risky,” says one Met gun cop. “But this could amount to a risk too far — not the risk of being shot, but of being more vulnerable to prosecution.” </p>
		<p>All this is being played out in a climate of growing public concern about police forces starting to look more like paramilitary outfits — as recently seen on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, following the police shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown.
		</p>
		<p>
No British firearms officer has ever been convicted of murder — two have been tried and acquitted — but the sense of vulnerability among them was heightened last month when one was charged with the murder of 24-year-old Azelle Rodney, who was shot eight times in 2005 in a car in which three guns were later found. Two gun cops have since resigned from the unit. </p>
		<p>Since 2005, there have been eight incidents involving nine fatal shootings by police. In all but two cases — those of Rodney and Jean Charles de Menezes, who was mistaken for a 7/7 bomber — inquests have returned verdicts of lawful killing.
“This is not about paramilitary policing and death squads,” says Basu. “Armed police are not paid any more than their unarmed colleagues; they are volunteers who risk their lives every day, and all they ask is that when they do their job, they are not criminalised and treated like murderers.” </p>
		<p>More police officers routinely carry weapons in the Metropolitan Police Service than in any other force in the UK — 2,155 out of a total of 31,000. These “authorised firearms officers”, or AFOs, are divided among eight departments responsible for reacting to spontaneous gun threats, policing airports, guarding embassies, fighting organised crime and so on. (Every police force in the country has its own complement of AFOs, but the number in each region varies. There are 6,091 armed officers in England and Wales, but most forces have fewer than 200 at their disposal.) </p>		
		<p>At the sharpest end of these departments is SC&O19. Its complement includes undercover drugs and anti-terrorism police, officers with expertise in kidnap and siege, specialist snipers and teams that either patrol 24/7 in 12 armed response vehicles (ARVs), provide support at gang-shooting hot spots or make intelligence-based interceptions aimed at taking weapons and dangerous criminals off the streets. Contrary to popular belief, they are outstandingly adept at not using their guns. During the three years to the end of 2013, armed Met police officers responded to 38,420 calls, but used weapons on only five occasions, firing a total of 19 shots that resulted in one death. </p>		
		<p>But that, of course, is one too many. In this case it was that of 29-year-old Mark Duggan in Tottenham on August 4, 2011, a shooting that sparked riots across England. </p>
		<p>I am in a BMW X5 ARV similar to one of three that stopped Duggan. Inside are three members of SC&O19’s Trojan Proactive Unit; they are proactive because they act on intelligence to arrest criminals thought to be carrying guns. Each has a Glock 17 handgun and a Taser, while in a safe inside the vehicle are two Heckler & Koch MP5 submachineguns and two G36 assault rifles. We are all wearing body armour. </p>		
		<p>In front, two more ARVs are about to bring a black Mercedes to what weapons tacticians call a “compliant stop” by flashing it down and driving to the front and rear of it. This car has been linked to firearms and drug crime in Hammersmith and is about to turn into an estate in Harlesden where there has been a spate of recent gang-related shootings. </p>	
		<p>
The compliant stop is used because there is no intelligence to suggest that a gun is on board. It involves AFOs showing their weapons but not pointing them while they politely ask the occupants to get out. If a weapon was thought to be in the Mercedes, the officers would conduct an “enforced stop”, leap out of their vehicles aggressively, pointing their guns and yelling: “Armed police!” Then they would extract the occupants by force. This is what happened to Duggan: during an extraction from a taxi he was shot twice. He was unarmed, but a handgun was found 20ft away. Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, a known “quartermaster” who stored guns for gangsters, was later convicted of supplying the gun and an inquest jury returned a verdict of lawful killing, a verdict that is being challenged by Duggan’s family. </p>
		<p>When they are brought to a halt, the four young men in the Mercedes at first look scared, then relieved. Their car reeks of cannabis, but a sniffer dog finds no drugs and no guns. The suspicion is they have come here for a pick-up; had they been stopped leaving the estate, the result might have been very different. </p>		
		<p>By the end of the evening, seven people, all known gang members, have been arrested, six for possession with intent to supply class A and B drugs, and one linked to a robbery. No weapons are recovered. </p>	
		<p>“Intense planning goes into every operation to ensure that only the minimum of force is used,” says the operation’s tactical firearms commander, Inspector Jon Templeton, a 42-year-old married man with two young sons. He has been in the Met for 20 years, the last five of them with the Trojan Proactive Unit. “We carry out thousands of operations every year and we do everything we possibly can to avoid opening fire. We will if we have to, but it is a decision and a responsibility that no one takes lightly — you have to justify every shot fired. If you fire once, then you have to justify that; if you fire again, you have to justify that too.
</p>
		<p>“Ultimately, we are answerable to the law for our actions; every officer knows and accepts that if an operation leads to a police shooting, the circumstances from the planning phase through to the officers’ actions after the shooting will be thoroughly investigated. You just hope it never comes to that. It’s the ambition of every firearms officer to retire without ever having fired a shot on operations.” </p>		
		<p>I was recently granted three weeks’ unprecedented access to SC&O19. During this period, its officers helped detain Michael Wheatley, aka “the Skull Cracker”, an infamously violent robber who had escaped from prison. They recovered two hand grenades, six guns, a selection of knives, a sword, a machete and a cache of ammunition; intercepted six men on their way to two robberies, replete with balaclavas, sledgehammers, knuckle-dusters and plastic handcuffs; arrested a mentally ill patient who had stabbed a beat officer; participated in the arrest of three men who had robbed a security van; and provided armed support for a further 54 pre-planned operations to detain criminals known to have firearms. </p>			
		<p>No shots were fired. </p>
		<p>Some days are quiet; others busy. The photographer Andrew Testa and I patrol with the Proactive Unit, racing through busy London streets with our “blues and twos” scattering lines of traffic. We answer calls about gangs of kids with machetes, gunmen threatening neighbours, knife-wielding thugs attacking unarmed police or members of the public swearing they have just seen a man with a gun. In almost all cases, the threat — whether real or imagined — has melted away by the time we arrive. But it only takes one to change a life, or to end it. </p>		
		<p>“The first call said something like, ‘Men in the street with knives and a gun,’ ” says Officer Y. Because he has been involved in a shooting incident, Y is called a “principal officer”. In common with other principal officers who agree to talk to me, Officer Y’s name remains a secret for his safety and that of his family. We can say that he is a softly spoken 35-year-old with a degree. “We were five miles from the scene when the call came in and we received information updates as we travelled, but there’s only so much you can take in. I remember someone using the word ‘chopping’. </p>			
		<p>“We got there in nine minutes. There were two men with knives and one did produce a gun later, but at first my focus centred on the other one. He was about 10 metres away and almost immediately began to run very fast towards us. Imagine turning a corner with the feeling that someone is looking for you, then seeing a flicker of recognition from a man with a bloodstained meat cleaver and a long knife. </p>
		<p>“We didn’t have time to get out of the car. He dropped the meat cleaver and came at us with the knife. I don’t remember seeing his face — I just saw his hand and the weapon — but I knew we were in danger and I had to use my firearm. There are ways of properly aiming a gun but I only had time to point and shoot through the open car window. He was just two metres away when I hit him in the arm and he spun round and went down. </p>		
		<p>“All the time, it was as if I was watching myself and I remember thinking, ‘Did that just happen? Did you really do that?’ And when it was all over I couldn’t believe I had fired two shots, yet at the same time I knew I definitely had. Can you understand that?” </p>			
		<p>The driver of the ARV had difficulty releasing her Glock from its holster as the attacker — Adebolajo — approached, but once Y had shot him, she covered him with a Taser. Meanwhile, unseen by Officer Y, Adebowale had outflanked them and taken aim with a handgun from the side of the road. He was shot by the third officer in the vehicle and then shot again when he raised his hand to try to fire. This shot took off his thumb. 
		</p>
		<p>Then Officer Y fetched a first-aid kit from the boot of the car and, in remarkable scenes that were filmed and relayed around the world, he and his colleagues set about saving the lives of the men who had butchered Lee Rigby. Adebolajo was given a whole life sentence, Adebowale 45 years. </p>		
		<p>Much of the angst over conferring and the use of cameras comes down to the gun cops’ understanding of their innate human limitations. The problem is that we all have unreliable recall. When stress is added to the mix, it becomes monumentally flawed, and they understand this more than most. Officer Y’s experience of not clearly remembering firing two shots is not unusual. I spoke to a number of principal officers who described similar difficulties recalling details of arguably the most important moment in their lives. </p>			
		<p>“After the incident at Woolwich, when we were conferring and trying to piece together what had happened, my colleague who shot Adebowale was convinced he went round our car one way before he fired, and I was convinced he went round it the other way,” says Officer Y. “We were both completely adamant about our version of events. In this case, it didn’t matter. But can you imagine what a barrister could do with such an inconsistency in a controversial case? He would say that one of us was lying — he would say our evidence was unreliable.” </p>
		<p>Following the Mark Duggan inquest, the IPCC proposed ending the practice of conferring, while Duggan’s family launched a High Court challenge against guidelines on conferring issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers. That will be heard in October.</p>		
		<p>Yet conferring is something the police have held sacrosanct since a 1953 legal challenge in which a judge approved of it, ruling that “nothing could be more natural and proper”. This, of course, is difficult to sell to a cynical public, which sees little difference between conferring and colluding. But to officers, conferring is a right they hold dear. </p>			
		<p>“When we confer, it is just over details that aren’t in dispute, like the name of the road we were in or what time it was,” a female AFO tells me. “We wouldn’t go as far as the moment of any shooting. You just wouldn’t do that. In common law there is a defence if you have an ‘honestly held belief’ in your version of events and the fact that you believed you were threatened. Why would you sacrifice that defence and exchange your recollections for someone else’s? That would take you into the realm of perjury and I don’t know anyone who would be prepared to do that.”</p>
		<p>I do not meet any AFOs who have issues over the wearing of cameras, but they all have concerns over how the evidence gleaned from those cameras would be used. Twelve Met gun cops are currently trialling them; depending on the outcome, all their colleagues could be required to wear them. </p>		
		<p>“Experience tells us that what we remember — especially in a stressful situation — will probably differ in some way from what the camera will record,” says Sergeant Mick Burke, a founder member of the Police Firearms Officers Association, a charity that supports gun cops, particularly principal officers. “And, of course, a camera can only see what is happening in front of an officer; it can’t take into account what he or she may hear behind them or see at the periphery. We need to know what safeguards will be in place to protect the officers before we can fully support the use of cameras. If their memories differ from what the camera records, will that undermine their evidence?” </p>
		<p>I am put through the “judgment range”, a sophisticated computer-controlled video simulator, to see how I would handle two scenarios involving gunmen, and how useful I would be as a witness afterwards. The first is a shooting spree at a school. There are bodies on the floor, and when I eventually come across the gunman, I shoot him. The second involves me disturbing two men as they are about to rob a betting shop. Again, I shoot one of them as he points a gun at me.</p>			
		<p>However, when I am questioned about the first scenario, I completely forget a room I had searched in which there was a dead child; I miscount the number of dead bodies in a corridor, describe the colour of the killer’s clothing incorrectly and am completely unaware that before I shot him, he had been shouting: “Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.” He would have shot someone on “moe”, but all my concentration was focused on his handgun. I heard no sounds at all. </p>
		<p>In the second scenario, I shoot the gunman as soon as he draws his gun. A later computer analysis confirms that he did have a gun, but also that I shot him before he produced it. My eyes had convinced me that it was there when it wasn’t. </p>		
		<p>Professor Lorraine Hope, an expert in applied cognitive psychology at the University of Portsmouth, has spent years researching eyewitness performance and memory retrieval under stress. She recently led a study in Canada in which 80 police officers were put through a simulated hostage scenario (half of them in the role of armed police; the other half as observers), at the end of which the hostage-taker burst into the room with a gun in his belt. He turned his back to the officers and then spun round, gesturing with his hands forward — but without the weapon.</p>			
		<p>Eighty-five per cent of the armed officers shot him, believing he was a threat to life, while 20% of those later insisted that they actually saw a gun in his hands. </p>			
		<p>“This isn’t surprising,” Prof Hope tells me. “In life-threatening situations, our cognitive performance is impaired. We only have so much capacity for processing information and at times of stress that capacity is reduced, and that can undermine our decision-making, perception and retrieval capabilities. If you are focused on someone or something that is threatening you in an evolving situation, then you are unlikely to notice or remember much else. Critically, your perception or understanding of the situation might also be distorted.” </p>
		<p>Officer Y says his experience backs this up. “When we arrived in Woolwich, I immediately saw both suspects, but as soon as one presented a threat, my entire focus was on him,” he recalls. “It was as if I didn’t have the capacity to process information about the other man and I didn’t become aware of him again until my colleague shot him. I think they call it ‘perceptual narrowing’.”</p>		
		<p>If the High Court doesn’t end the practice first, the IPCC is expected to ask the home secretary, Theresa May, to proscribe conferring early next year. One possibility if she accepts the proposal is that principal officers, aware of the natural potential for inconsistencies in their evidence, will worry about being regarded as suspects, not witnesses, and will exercise their right not to comment. This could cause chaos. </p>						
		<p>“Wouldn’t it make sense to stop treating officers like criminals and seek their co-operation instead?” asks Commander Basu when we meet in his office at New Scotland Yard. There is no sign that he is bluffing; he can barely conceal his contempt for the IPCC. “If someone has to take a life, then what they need to do is talk about it. The last thing they need in such a traumatised state is to be locked in a room on their own and told they can’t speak to their colleagues. What kind of message does that send? It assumes they have done something wrong and if that assumption is made, then they may well choose not to co-operate with the investigation. </p>		
		<p>“If the IPCC continues to demonise firearms officers like this, I honestly believe we’re going to have problems recruiting in the future. Good police officers are going to take the view that it simply isn’t worth the risk of picking up a gun to defend the public.” </p>			
		<p>For now, the IPCC and Scotland Yard remain at loggerheads. Moir Stewart, the IPCC’s director of investigations, is unmoved by Commander Basu’s warnings. “Separating officers after an incident… adds integrity to their accounts and protects them from accusations of a cover-up,” he says. </p>			
		<p>As for the men and women of SC&O19, they continue to do their job. Before we part, I ask a group of them to recall incidents that had made an impression on them. “The time we rescued the kid who was going to be killed by one gang as part of a peace deal with another,” recalls one. “A couple of minutes later and he’d have been dead.” </p>
		<p>Another remembers finding and saving a gunshot victim who had hidden and then passed out, while a third’s favourite moment was arriving at a house in time to stop an armed and suicidal man from killing himself. “He thanked us later,” he says.Then, unexpectedly, one aspect of the job comes to light that I hadn’t considered. </p>		
		<p>“Where guns are involved, we’re the first emergency service to go in and we give first aid before the paramedics arrive,” says one of the officers. “So I remember all the times we’ve been able to save a life. But we’re also first to cradle the dying young men who’ve been shot, and to lie that everything is going to be all right when it isn’t. I’ve done too many of those.” </p>
