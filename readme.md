# Problem 
- if you're reading a longform article on a website, you can't placehold (or placehold in multiple spots) as you might in a newspaper
- we shouldn't mandate that longform articles be app-based
- as a solution we present an HTML5 tool to bookmark your position(s) to come back to later 

# Solution 
Bookmark tool for 
- anyone who has a website and is able to control their codebase 
- anyone who wants to give readers the ability to bookmark an HTML page

## Known Issues 
On the older Android stock browser, click events fire when scrolling

## Roadmap Ideas 
- UI<br/>
-- smooth scrolling<br/>
-- onboarding function e.g. append Save My Spot to viewport bottom<br/>
-- “favourites” page to collect saved spots from multiple stories<br/>
- Personalisation / User Preferences<br/>
-- set / clear localStorage via icons in My Placeholder menu<br/>
--  behaviour of page on-reload <br/>
- Share saved spots across multiple devices <br/>
-- Pocket for personal use (Sense Checking) <br/>
-- send saved spots to other users <br/>
- Publisher-friendly<br/>
-- Add Save My Spot to any Webpage with a single line of JavaScript (like Google Analytics)
