# Save My Spot

Save My Spot is a placeholding tool that relies on HTML5 local storage. This project arose from _The Times_ and _The Sunday Times_ <a href="http://buildthenews.wordpress.com/">Build The News</a> hack weekend in October 2014, where it won 'Special Commendation'. Here's the <a href="https://radiocontrolled.github.io/build-the-news/">demo</a>.

## Problem 
* if you're reading a longform article on a website, you can't placehold (or placehold in multiple spots) as you might in a newspaper
* Web readers may expect app-like behaviour from Websites
* as a solution we present an HTML5 tool to bookmark your position(s) to come back to later 

## Solution 
Bookmark tool for 
* anyone who has a website and is able to control their codebase 
* anyone who wants to give readers the ability to place bookmarks on an HTML page

## Known issues 
* On the older Android stock browser, click events fire when scrolling

## Roadmap ideas from the Build the News hack weekend 
* UI<br/>
 * smooth scrolling
 * onboarding function e.g. append Save My Spot to viewport bottom
 * “favourites” page to collect saved spots from multiple stories
* Personalisation / User Preferences
 * ~~set / clear localStorage via icons in My Placeholder menu~~
 *  behaviour of page on-reload 
* Share saved spots across multiple devices 
 * Pocket for personal use (Sense Checking) 
 * send saved spots to other users 
* Publisher-friendly
 * Add Save My Spot to any Webpage with a single line of JavaScript
